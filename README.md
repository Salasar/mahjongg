Mahjongg Solitaire - one of the first videogames which I played.

The demo: https://salasar.github.io/mahjongg/. It's better to play on landscape orientation.

Doesn't consist an algorithm for a guaranteed win. But the chance of a defeat is about 2,96%, so all is not lost. :)

I wish you good luck and become a master on the difficult way of Mahjongg. 

Enjoy!
